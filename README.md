# Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze Zomato data using Python and its libraries. The analysis will provide insights into restaurant preferences, services, and pricing trends among customers.

## Libraries Used
- **Numpy**: Efficient handling of large computations and arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: Creating high-quality plots and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: Simplifying data loading, manipulation, and analysis tasks.
- **Seaborn**: Creating visually appealing statistical graphics.

## Analysis Questions
The analysis addresses the following questions:
1. Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
2. Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
3. What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: Load the Zomato dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and basic statistics.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, format columns, and remove duplicates if necessary.
4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Compare the count of restaurants providing online delivery versus offline services.
   - Analyze the popularity of different types of restaurants based on customer reviews or ratings.
   - Investigate the price range preferred by couples for dinner.
5. **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations for better understanding.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the Zomato data, this project aims to provide valuable insights for restaurant owners, customers, and stakeholders, helping them make informed decisions and understand consumer preferences better.
